    "- Print out a “menu” or items to buy with their prices. There must be at least 3 items. Please change this to make it more interesting than apples, bananas, and carrots!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt the user for something they would like to buy; If the user enters the string that matches an item from the menu, the cost should be added to the total cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt the user if they wish to continue shopping; If the user enters “yes” (capitalization does not matter as any version of “Yes”, “YES”, “yeS” will suffice) continue looping and asking what they want to buy.\n",

    "- After the loop, output the total cost. Note that the number should be immediately preceded by a \\$ (no space between)"
